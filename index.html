                Hello, my name is Jason Riley and I a 18 years old. I was born and raised in San Diego and I went to school at West Hills High School.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time I like to watch netflix at home or go out with my friends. I like to surf and I enjoy being outdoors a lot. When I have some time where I have no work to do and I am bored I like to play video games on my Xbox one.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day I hope to have a job that I enjoy waking up to do everyday. I want to be someone who creates things that make life easier for everyone else. I hope that one day I am able to make all of this happen.
            </p>
